# Display OGC API Feature Collection

This sample demonstrates how to display an OGC API feature collection and query features while navigating the map view.

## Use case

When panning the map view, it may be necessary to query the OGC API feature table for additional features within the new visible extent.

## How to use the sample

Pan the map and observe how new features are loaded from the OGC API feature service.

## How it works

1. Create an `OgcFeatureCollectionTable` object using a URL to an OGC API feature service and a collection ID.
2. Set the feature table's `FeatureRequestMode` to `ManualCache` so features requested from the server are cached locally.
3. Create a `FeatureLayer` using the feature table and add it to the Map's `operationalLayers`.
4. Every time the map view navigation completes:
    i. Create `QueryParameters`
    ii. Set the parameter's `Geometry` to the current extent of the map view. 
    iii. Set the parameter's `SpatialRelationship` to `Intersects`.
    iv. Set the `MaxFeatures` property to 5000 (some services have a low default value for maximum features).
    v. Call `OgcFeatureCollectionTable->PopulateFromService()` using the query parameters from the previous steps.
