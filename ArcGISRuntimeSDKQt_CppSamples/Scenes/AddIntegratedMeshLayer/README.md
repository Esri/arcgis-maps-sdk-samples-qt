## Use case

An integrated mesh is used to generate a mesh over a point dataset. They are most often used on high-density point datasets to create a high-resolution seamless surface.

## How to use the sample

Run the sample and watch the integrated mesh layer load in place of the extruded imagery basemap. Navigate around the scene to visualize the high level of detail on the cliffs and valley floor.

## How it works

1. Create an `Scene`.
2. Create an `IntegratedMeshLayer` with the URL to an integrated mesh layer scene service.
3. Add the layer to the scene's operational layers.

## Relevant API

* IntegratedMeshLayer

## About the data

This integrated mesh depicts the city of Girona, Spain and is attributed to the Institut Cartogràfic i Geològic de Catalunya (ICGC). The data was produced from [photogrammetrically correct imagery](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/help/data/imagery/ortho-mapping-in-arcgis-pro.htm). Areas of white space within the integrated mesh are areas that had poor overlapping coverage from photos.

## Additional information

An integrated mesh layer can also be added to a scene from a local data source - either from a scene layer package (.slpk) or a mobile scene package (.mspk).
