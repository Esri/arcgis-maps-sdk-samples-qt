# Perform valve isolation trace

Run a filtered trace to locate operable features that will isolate an area from the flow of network resources.

## Use case

Determine the set of operable features required to stop a network's resource, effectively isolating an area of the network. For example, you can choose to return only accessible and operable valves: ones that are not paved over or rusted shut.

## How to use the sample

Select one or more features to use as filter barriers or create and set the configuration's filter barriers by selecting a category. Check or uncheck 'Include isolated features'. Press 'Trace' to run a subnetwork-based isolation trace. Press 'Reset' to clear filter barriers.

## How it works

1. Create a `MapView` and connect to its `mouseClicked` signal.
2. Create and load a `Map` with a web map item URL that contains a `UtilityNetwork`.
3. Get and load the first `UtilityNetwork` from the web map.
4. Add a `GraphicsOverlay` with a `Graphic` that represents the starting location, and another graphics overlay for the filter barriers.
5. Populate the list of filter barrier categories from `UtilityNetworkDefinition::categories`.
6. When the map view is clicked, identify which features are at that location and add a graphic that represents a filter barrier.
7. Create a `UtilityElement` for the identified feature and add this utility element to a list of filter barriers.
   - If the element is a junction with more than one terminal, display a terminal picker. Then set the junction's `terminal` property with the selected terminal.
   - If an edge, set its `fractionAlongEdge` property using `GeometryEngine::fractionAlong`.
8. When "Trace" is pressed:
   - Create `UtilityTraceParameters` with `UtilityTraceType::Isolation` and a starting location from a given asset type and global ID.
   - Set the `UtilityTraceParameters::traceConfiguration` property from a default `UtilityTraceConfiguration`. Set the `filter` property with an `UtilityTraceFilter` object.
9. If 'Trace' is clicked without filter barriers:
   - Create a new `UtilityCategoryComparison` with the selected category and `UtilityCategoryComparisonOperator::Exists`.
   - Create a new `UtilityTraceFilter` with this condition as `Barriers` to set `Filter` and update `IncludeIsolatedFeatures` properties of the default configuration from step 5.
   - Run `UtilityNetwork::trace`.
10. If `Trace` is clicked with filter barriers:
   - Update `IncludeIsolatedFeatures` property of the default configuration from step 5.
   - Run `UtilityNetwork::trace`.
11.  For every `FeatureLayer` in the map, select the features returned by `featuresForElementsAsync` from the elements matching their `NetworkSource::name` with the layer's `FeatureTable::name`.

## About the data

The [Naperville gas](https://sampleserver7.arcgisonline.com/server/rest/services/UtilityNetwork/NapervilleGas/FeatureServer) network feature service, hosted on ArcGIS Online (authentication required: this is handled within the sample code), contains a utility network used to run the isolation trace shown in this sample.
