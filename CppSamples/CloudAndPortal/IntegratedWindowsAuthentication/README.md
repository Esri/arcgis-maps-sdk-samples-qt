# Integrated windows authentication

Uses Windows credentials to access services hosted on a portal secured with Integrated Windows Authentication (IWA).

## Use case

IWA, which is built into Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS), works well for intranet applications, but isn't always practical for internet apps.

## How to use the sample

Enter the URL to your IWA-secured portal in the text field at the top of the screen and click "Search Secure". You will be prompted for a username (including domain, such as username@DOMAIN or domain\username), and password. On Windows it will automatically use your current login credentials. If you authenticate successfully, portal item results will display in the combo box below. Select a web map item and click the "Load Web Map" button to display it in the map view.

## How it works

1. The `AuthenticationManager` object is configured with a challenge handler that will prompt for a Windows login (username, password, and domain) if a secure resource is encountered.
2. When a search for portal items is performed against an IWA-secured portal, the challenge handler creates an `Credential` object from the information entered by the user.
3. If the user authenticates, the search returns a list of web maps (`PortalItem`) and the user can select one to display as a `Map`.
4. On some platforms, the current Windows account is used by default and a login prompt will not be shown if it can authenticate successfully.

## About the data

This sample searches for web map portal items on a secure portal. To successfully run the sample, you need:
 - Access to a portal secured with Integrated Windows Authentication that contains one or more web map items.
 - A login that grants you access to the portal.
