# Animate 3D symbols

Demonstrates how to animate a graphic's position and rotation and follow it using a `OrbitGeoElementCameraController`.
Also shows how to combine a `SceneView` and `MapView` in an MVC application with property binding.

## How to use the sample

Animation Controls (Top Left Corner):
 - Select a mission -- selects a location with a route for the plane to fly
 - Play/Pause -- toggles playing and stopping the animation
 - Fixed/Follow -- toggles the camera's free cam mode and follow
 - Mission progress -- shows how far along the route the plane is. Slide to change keyframe in animation

Camera Controls (Top Right Corner):
 - Camare zoom -- distance between camera and plane
 - Camera angle -- viewing angle between camera and plane
 - Flight speed -- controls speed of animation

 2D Map Controls (Bottom Left Corner):
 - Plus and Minus -- controls distance of 2D view from ground level

## How it works

1. Create a `GraphicsOverlay` and add it to the `SceneView`.
2. Create a `ModelSceneSymbol` object.
3. Create a `Graphic` object and set its geometry to a `Point`.
4. Set the `ModelSceneSymbol` object to the graphic.
5. Add heading, pitch, and roll attributes to the graphic. Get the attributes from the graphic with `Graphic::attributes`.
6. Create a `SimpleRenderer` object and set its expression properties.
7. Add graphic and a renderer to the graphics overlay.
8. Create a `OrbitGeoElementCameraController` which is set to target the graphic.
9. Assign the camera controller to the `SceneView`.
10. Update the graphic's location, heading, pitch, and roll.
