# Feature layer (dictionary renderer)

Convert features into graphics to show them with mil2525d symbols.

## Use case

A dictionary renderer uses a style file along with a rule engine to display advanced symbology.
This is useful for displaying features using precise military symbology.

## How to use the sample

Pan and zoom around the map. Observe the displayed military symbology on the map.

## How it works

1. Create a `Geodatabase` with a given path.
2. Wait for geodatabase to completely load by connecting to the `loadStatusChanged` signal and checking the `loadStatus`.
3. Cycle through each `GeodatabaseFeatureTable` from the geodatabase using `Geodatabase.geodatabaseFeatureTables()`.
4. Create a `FeatureLayer` from each table within the geodatabase.
5. Wait for each layer to load by connecting to the layer's `loadStatusChanged` signal and checking the `loadStatus`.
6. After the last layer has loaded, then create a new `Envelope` from a union of the extents of all layers.
   * Set the envelope to be the `Viewpoint` of the map view using `MapView.setViewpoint(new Viewpoint(Envelope))`.
7. Add the feature layer to map using `Map.operationalLayers.append(FeatureLayer)`.
8. Create `DictionaryRenderer` and attach to the feature layer by setting `FeatureLayer.renderer`.
